          <strong>Pass (unlicensed — the case here):</strong> the headless list
          renders its controls with no threads, and the drawer renders its
          <em>locked</em> state. The locked state is the correct result: it
          proves the drawer mounted and read the platform's
          <code>threads</code> license feature.
          <strong>Pass (licensed):</strong> threads list, selecting a row
          replays that conversation into the chat beside it, and rename /
          archive / delete take effect.
          <strong>Fail:</strong> a blank area with no locked state at all.

        Threads are served by the Enterprise Intelligence Platform through the
        runtime, not by AWS Strands. Without a license key the list is empty by design
